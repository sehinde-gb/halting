## Advent of Code 2020 Day8

- Day 8: Handheld Halting


## Description

- Your flight to the major airline hub reaches cruising altitude without incident. 
- While you consider checking the in-flight menu for one of those drinks that come with a little umbrella, you are interrupted by the kid sitting next to you.
- It seems like you're not the only one having problems, though; a very long line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could upset your travel itinerary.
